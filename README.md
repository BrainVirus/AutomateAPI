# Special Thanks
Special thanks to a number of people whose help (and in certain cases code) I have used within this project

**Chris Taylor** where I have re-used and modified certain parts of the ConnectWise Control module to send commands to Contrl and his ConnectWise Automate module so we can reinstall services

**Darren White** for his pre-input and then ongoing support with the code

**Mendy Green** for helping me test the initial code

**Davíð Snædal** for his assistance before this module even started with guidance on connection to the Automate REST APIs

**ConnectWise** for absolutely smashing the delivery of their API
